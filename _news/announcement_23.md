Our work [miniBEHAVIOR](https://github.com/stanfordvl/mini_behavior) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01824v1.pdf)) has been accepted for presentation at two NeurIPS workshops: [Agent Learning in Open-Endedness (ALOE)](https://sites.google.com/view/aloe2023) and [Generalization in Planning (GenPlan)](https://aair-lab.github.io/genplan23/). MiniBEHAVIOR is a novel benchmark that extends the 2D gridworld miniGrid to include semantically meaningful tasks from [BEHAVIOR-1K](https://behavior.stanford.edu/behavior-1k), enabling fast development and prototyping for reasoning in household activities. Congratulations Jiaheng and the rest of the team!

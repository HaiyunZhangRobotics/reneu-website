Beginning of the [UT Summer Academy](https://fri.cns.utexas.edu/community-outreach/summer-high-school-research-academy) offered by the RobIn lab. 25 students will fabricate their own copies of [BaRiFlex](https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/bariflex/) (design by Gu-Cheol), collect data and train imitation learning policies for manipulation. It is going to be fun!

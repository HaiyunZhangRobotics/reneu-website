Roberto gives a talk at the ICRA24 workshop [Vision-Language Models for Navigation and Manipulation (VLMNM)](https://vlmnm-workshop.github.io/) on "Language as Bridge between Simulation and the Real World" (Albert's [RSS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10020)). During his talk, he connected live with Austin to teleoperate remotely our Tiago robot using [TeleMoMa](https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/telemoma-web/) (Shivin's [paper](https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/telemoma-web/static/pdfs/telemoma.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/UT-Austin-RobIn/telemoma)), our teleoperation framework for mobile manipulators! Japan-US connection!

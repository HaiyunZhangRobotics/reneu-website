Welcome to our lab website! We are developing innovative robotic devices to improve the quality of life and rehabilitation of those surviving a disability.

The Lab is part of the Mechanical Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Austin. We are also associated with the [Texas Robotics](https://robotics.utexas.edu/) consortium located in the Anna Hiss Gymnasium ([AHG](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/maps/UTM/AHG/)).

<!-- RobIn Lab is directed by [Roberto Martín-Martín](https://robertomartinmartin.com/), and is part of the University of Texas at Austin, Department of Computer Science, UTAI Lab and Texas Robotics.

The research in RobIn explores at the intersection of <u>robotics</u>, <u>computer vision</u> and <u>machine learning</u>, with an emphasis on creating robotic solutions that accomplish <u>interaction-rich</u> tasks in the real world. Our research revolves around the question: what are the mechanisms that enable *physically intelligent behavior* in embodied agents? Our hypothesis is that intelligence is not a purely computational process, but an interplay between perceiving, reasoning, learning and <u>interacting physically</u> with the world.

Keywords in our research include: learning (reinforcement learning, imitation learning, representation learning), planning (motion planning, task planning, TAMP), control (optimal control, force control), perception (active, interactive, multimodal perception), 2D and 3D reasoning, and Bayesian state estimation, sim2real. Application domains we find exciting involve: mobile manipulation, stationary manipulation, contact-rich manipulation, social and visual navigation.

We are always looking for outstanding new members and collaborators for RobIn. Please, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffvYGQ74fz2c-GvBfTGbuXGxupA0Y8Iy4s88UfVu7Gfb1c1A/viewform) and state clearly if you are an UG/MSc/PhD from UT, or a prospective visitor.
